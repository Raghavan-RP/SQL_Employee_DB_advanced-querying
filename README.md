# SQL_Employee_DB_advanced-querying

In this project, I've used intermediate to advanced level SQL queries to explore the employee database of a company.

For demonstration purposes, I created a employee database with multiple tables and around 10-15 records per table.

I've used various SQL techniques such as Joins, Sub-queries, CTEs, Text functions and so on to analyze the data.
